#### Problem

Many people only read one or two articles about any given news story.
But different articles can portray the same event in slightly or very 
different ways. The reader's point of view can be shaped by the connotations of the words the author chooses, and the inclusion/exclusion of certain facts, influenced by the author's inherent conscious or subconscious biases.
For example, one news platform might reference "freedom fighter" while another references "terrorist".
In extreme cases, 2 articles on the same topic can have completely contradictory headlines:

#### Solution

With Perspectives, our goal is to promote the awareness of multiple perspectives
on newsworthy content.
We want to equip everyday media consumers like you with as many versions of the 'truth' as possible,
enabling them to 

Perspectives is a Chrome extension that allows news readers to seamlessly discover alternative accounts of any article they read online.
Through the extension, the reader is shown alternative articles which have different words, phrases, and information than the one you were reading before.

The beauty of this application is that it allows the possibility to see
what an initial article may have missed. Users can immerse themselves in other
perspectives, and, in the process, become better armed to identify bias.In this
application, we extract key words and noun phrases from an article a user is 
reading. We use those key words to query several web APIs and scrape other news
sources that may provide alternative views. We do semantic differential analysis 
using natural language processing tools like NLTK and Wordnet to measure these
differences and we deliver you the best results to expand your views. The next
steps for our project involved integrating more APIs, supplementing news articles
with social media news. 

In the U.S. the Pew Research Center found that believability ratings for news outlets is at its lowest in at least 30 years. Our project raises the credibility of ALL news sources, by offering a more transparent viewer interaction with them. We hope that a tool like this can legitimize and humanize people who have different backgrounds and viewpoints than ourselves.
